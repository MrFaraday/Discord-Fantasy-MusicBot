# Discord Fantasy Music Bot

This music bot designed for playing along with tabletop RPG (such as DnD or Pathfinder) or other board games. I make it especially for using by GM(DM) to quick switching between differnt playlists or tracks. But you can use it as regular music bot.

#### Features

- High performance
- Quick slots for tracks/playlists
- Smooth playing
